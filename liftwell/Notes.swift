// It'd be nice to filter this by exercise type and perhaps apparatus so that users don't have
// to wade through a ton of exercises to select the matching one. But it's not always clear how
// to categorize an exercise, e.g. a back extension could equally sensibly be body weight or
// dumbbell. And there are programs that do odd things like turning a cable seated row into a
// timed exercise by having users do as many reps as possible within a time window.
