* Attempt to increase weights by 5-10 pounds each week.
* Focus on activating the glutes with each exercise.
* When performing a single leg/arm exercise begin with the weaker limb and then do the same number of reps with the stronger limb.
* If you're having an off day don't continue a set if your form begins to break down.
* Unlike the other Strong Curves workouts this one is not set up for super-setting.
* Once you've done all the indicated workouts the app will prompt you to move onto the next program.
