This is a [program](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/zc0uy/a_beginner_dumbbell_program_the_dumbbell_stopgap/) for people who lack access to barbells. It's three days a week where workouts alternate between the A and B days:

**A**
* Bulgarian Split Squat 3x5-10
* Bench Press 3x5-10
* Straight-legged Deadlift 3x5-10
* Plank 3 sets

**B**
* Bulgarian Split Squat 3x5-10
* Seated Overhead Press 3x5-10
* Bent over Row 3x5-10
* Plank 3 sets

**Notes**
* If your lightest dumbbell is too heavy you can begin with empty hands.
* If you stall on a lift three times in a row lower the weight by two steps.
* There are some optional exercises you can swap in using the Options button in workouts.
* Progression is easier with 2.5 pound magnets.
