[This program](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/gzclp) and [5/3/1](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/531-beginners) are the two programs recommended by reddit/fitness if you're familiar with the barbell lifts or if you have run [Phrak's Greyskull](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/phraks-gslp) program for a few months. This program is a bit more complex than most other beginner programs but offers a more balanced selection of exercises and more sophisticated weight progression.

The exercises are divided up into three [tiers](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html), Tier 1 are the main lifts. They are done as 5x3+ (where the plus means As Many Reps As Possible for the last set). If you are able to do 3 or more reps in the last set the weight is automatically increased. If you can't do 3 reps on the AMRAP set then the next time 6x2+ is used. When you fail on that 10x1+ is used. When that fails the app will ask you to rest 2-3 days and then help you find a new five rep max to start the cycle over again.

Tier 2 are exercises that directly support your main lifts. These start with 3x10. As before if you are able to do all the reps the weight is automatically increased. If you can't do all the reps this will change to 3x8 and then 3x6. Once 3x6 fails you'll be asked to add weight to whatever you lifted for the 3x10 sets and the cycle starts over.

Tier 3 is designed to address individual body parts and is done with 3x15+. Weight is increased automatically once you're able to do 25 reps on the AMRAP set.

**Notes**
* Avoid lifting to failure on the AMRAP sets: if you're not sure you can squeeze out one more set or if the bar slows down significantly then stop.
* Add five pounds to upper body T1 and T2 lifts. Add ten pounds to lower body T1 and T2 lifts.
* Don't do more than ten T1 AMRAP reps.
