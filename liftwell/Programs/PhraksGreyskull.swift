This is the [beginner program](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/phraks-gslp) recommended by reddit/fitness. After three months (or if you are already familiar with bench press, overhead
press, squat, and deadlift) then switch to either [5/3/1 for Beginners](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/531-beginners) or [GZCLP](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/gzclp). This is a three day a week program:

**1A**
* Chin Ups 3x5+
* OHP 3x5+
* Squat 3x5+

**1B**
* Rows 3x5+
* Bench Press 3x5+
* Deadlift 1x5+

**1C**
* Chin Ups 3x5+
* OHP 3x5+
* Squat 3x5+

**2A**
* Rows 3x5+
* Bench Press 3x5+
* Squat 3x5+

**2B**
* Chin Ups 3x5+
* OHP 3x5+
* Deadlift 1x5+

**2C**
* Rows 3x5+
* Bench Press 3x5+
* Squat 3x5+

**Notes**
* The + means that the last set is As Many Reps as Possible (AMRAP). But don't do these to failure: try and leave one or two reps in the tank, e.g. stop if the bar speed slows significantly.
* Add 2.5 pounds to upper body lifts (you may need micro-plates or magnets). Add five pounds to lower body lifts.
* If you're able to do more than 10 reps on the AMRAP set then you can add twice as much weight.
* If you fail to do at least fifteen reps then deload that lift by 10%.
* If you can't do chin ups then do negatives (slowly lower yourself).
* It is recommended to include cardio work.
* Avoid making other changes to the program.
