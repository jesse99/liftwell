This is a program for older lifters. It's based on programming principles from the book [The Barbell Prescription: Strength Training for Life After 40](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y4LXFCK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). The [Limber 11](https://imgur.com/gallery/iEsaS) stretches should ideally be done several times a week. It's a three day a week program and the days look like this:

**Heavy** (should be a struggle to finish all the reps)
* Squat 3x3-5
* Bench Press 3x3-5
* Deadlift 1x3-5

**Light**
* OHP 3x3-5
* Chinups 3 sets with a goal of 20 total reps
* Cable Crunches 3x6-12
* Face Pulls 3x6-12

**Medium**  (should feel like you are working hard but in no danger of missing a rep)
* Bench Press 2x4-6 @ 94%
* Squat 2x4-6 @ 94%
* Chinups 3 sets with a goal of 20 total reps
* Kroc Row 3x9-18

**Limber 11**
* Foam Rolling
* Shoulder Dislocates
* Bent-knee Iron Cross
* Roll-over into V-sit
* Rocking Frog Stretch
* Fire Hydrant Hip Circle
* Mountain Climber
* Cossack Squat
* Piriformis Stretch
