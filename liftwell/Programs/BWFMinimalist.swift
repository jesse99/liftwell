This is a bare bones program from the [bodyweight fitness](https://old.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/minroutine) reddit. You can do this program every day, but if you want to gain strength it's best to do it three times a week with a day of rest between each workout. Do 2-6 circuits of the following exercises:

**Workout**
* Walking Lunges 1x5-10
* [Pushup Progression](https://old.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/pushup) 1x5-10
* [Row Progression](https://old.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/row) 1x5-10
* Plank Shoulder Taps 1x5-10

**Notes**
* Once you can do three circuits of push ups or rows at 8-10 reps you can move on to a harder version.
* Take little or no rest.
* Additional exercises can be enabled via the Workout options screen.
