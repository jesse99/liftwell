* This is a three day a week program designed to be performed at home.
* You'll need a bit of equipment for this program: an exercise mat, a swiss ball, valslides (or a towel if you have smooth floors). a chin-up bar, and a PVC pipe/dowel/broomstick.
* Don't be too aggressive about upping the rep ranges: the first and last reps you do should feel the same.
* When performing a single leg/arm exercise begin with the weaker limb and then do the same number of reps with the stronger limb.
* To speed up the workouts you can superset the exercises: do a set of a lower body exercise, a set of an upper body, rest for 60-120s, and repeat until you've finished all the sets for both exercises.
* Once you've done all the indicated workouts the app will prompt you to move onto the next program.
