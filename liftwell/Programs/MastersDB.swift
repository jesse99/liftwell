This is a dumbbell only program for older lifters. It's based on programming principles from the book [The Barbell Prescription: Strength Training for Life After 40](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y4LXFCK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). The [Limber 11](https://imgur.com/gallery/iEsaS) stretches should ideally be done several times a week. It's a three day a week program and the days look like this:

**Heavy** (should be a struggle to finish all the reps)
* Dumbbell Bench 3x6-12
* Bulgarian Split Squat 3x4-8
* Chinups to 25 reps
* Kroc Row 3x6-12

**Light**
* Dumbbell OHP 3x5-10
* Back Extensions 3x6-12
* Dumbbell Flyes 3x6-12

**Medium**  (should feel like you are working hard but in no danger of missing a rep)
* Dumbbell Bench 3x10 @ 94%
* Bulgarian Split Squat 3x6 @ 94%
* Chinups to 25 reps
* Kroc Row 3x6-12

**Limber 11**
* Foam Rolling
* Shoulder Dislocates
* Bent-knee Iron Cross
* Roll-over into V-sit
* Rocking Frog Stretch
* Fire Hydrant Hip Circle
* Mountain Climber
* Cossack Squat
* Piriformis Stretch
