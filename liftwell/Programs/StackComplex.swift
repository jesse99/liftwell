This is a program from [Stack](https://www.stack.com/a/a-dumbbell-complex-workout-to-build-muscle-and-quickly-shed-fat). It's a complex which means each exercise is done with the same set of weights, the weights should not leave your hands until a set is done, and you should aim for not resting until a set is finished.

**Workout**
* DB Push Press 8 reps
* DB Front Squat 8 reps
* DB Romanian Deadlifts 8 reps
* DB Bent-over Row 8 reps
* DB Elevated Pushups 8 reps
* Max effort bike sprint 30s
