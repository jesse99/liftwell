Each day has a main lift, a secondary lift, and customizable assistence lifts. The main lift works up to a 1+ AMRAP set followed by five or six backoff sets. The secondary lift is done at less intensity. Assistence work is typically three sets at 8-12 reps. For the main lifts weights should be increased based on how well you did on the 1+ set:
* If you did 0-1 reps then don't increase the weight.
* If you did 2-3 reps then increase the weight by one step (n-Suns recommends five pounds).
* If you did 4-5 reps then increase the weight by one or two steps.
* If you did 6+ reps then increase the weight by two or three steps.
"""

fileprivate let notes = """
* When starting the program you need to find your Training Max for each of the main lifts. The program will do this for you: when you start an exercise it will guide you to find the five rep max for that exercise, then it will estimate your one rep max, and use 90% of the 1RM for your training max.
* This program uses a lot of sets at a relatively low intensity so be conservative with your initial weights.
* Don't do the AMRAP sets to failure: try and leave one or two reps in the tank, e.g. stop if the bar speed slows significantly.
* You can do up to four assistence lifts during a workout.
* The assistence lifts should be tailored to address your weak areas.
* Wendler recommends a 10% deload for a lift if you think you've stalled on it.
