* Bret recommends spending 10-15 minutes warming up before each workout.

* For the Stick/Tiger Tail roller warmup hit the IT-band, quads, calves, and shins.
* Focus on activating the glutes with each exercise.
* When performing a single leg/arm exercise begin with the weaker limb and then do the same number of reps with the stronger limb.
* If you're having an off day don't continue a set if your form begins to break down.
* To speed up the workouts you can superset the exercises: do a set of a lower body exercise, a set of an upper body, rest for 60-120s, and repeat until you've finished all the sets for both exercises.
* Once you've done all the indicated workouts the app will prompt you to move onto the next program.
