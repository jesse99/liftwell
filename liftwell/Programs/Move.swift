This is a bodyweight fitness [program](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/move) from reddit. It will help build strength but also has an emphasis on mobility and flexibility. It's suitable for beginners and can be run for two years or even longer. It's divided up into five phases. The [first phase](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/move/phase1) looks like this:

**Stength and Body Control**
* Wrist Mobility 2-5 mins
* Scapula Shrugs 3x10
* Scapula Rows 3x10
* Plank 10-60s
* Reverse Plank 10-60s
* Bear Crawl 2 mins (counting any rest you may need)
* Sitting Squat 3x10-30s

**Stretching and Mobility**
* Child's Pose 30-60s
* Child's Pose with Lat Stretch 30-60s (for each side)
* Wall Extensions 1x10
* Chest Wall Stretch 30-60s (for each side)
* Calf Stretch 30-60s (for each side)
* Hamstring Lunge 30-60s (for each side)
* Leg Lifts 3x10 (alternate sides)
* Hip Flexor Stretch 30-60s

**Notes**
* Move on to phase two when you can do the plank and reverse plank for 30s.
* But spend at least two weeks on this phase.
* Do the above 3x a week.
