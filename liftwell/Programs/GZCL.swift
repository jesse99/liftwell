[GZCL](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html) from Cody Lefever isn't really a program but more of a template describing how to organize your [workouts](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html). The workouts are organized into tiers:

**Tier 1**
These are the exercises that you think are the most important, typically squat, bench press, deadlift, and perhaps OHP. Tier 1 exercises are performed first within a workout for 10-15 total reps with 1-3 reps per set. All the reps should be completed without too much grinding. If not drop the weight and finish your reps (this can be done just for that workout if the problem is due to something like a bad night's rest or for the mesocycle if it's a persistent problem).

**Tier 2**
These are primary accessories for the main lift. They can be the main lifts themselves (e.g. using backoff sets) or exercises like front squat, decline bench, good mornings, rows, pull ups, lat pull down, etc. These are done after the tier 1 lifts for twice as many total reps as in tier 1 with 5-8 reps per set. You should be able to complete all these reps.

**Tier 3**
These are used to train body parts that you think need extra work. You can do 1-3 exercises here for three times as many total reps as in tier 1 with 8-12 reps per set.

Here's the built-in GZCL workout:

**Squat**
* T1 Squat
* T2 Front Squat
* T3 Leg Curl
* T3 Leg Extension

**Bench Press**
* T1 Bench Press
* T2 Decline Bench
* T3 Dips
* T3 Skullcrusher

**Deadlift**
* T1 Deadlift
* T2 Good Morning
* T3 Shrugs
* T3 Pendlay Row

**Overhead Press**
* T1 OHP
* T2 Incline Bench
* T3 Arnold Press
* T3 Lateral Raise

To speed up your workout you can super-set the tier 3 and tier 2 lifts.

Typically GZCL is run using a multi-week mesocycle where the weights in tier 1 and 2 gradually increase with total reps dropping. The last week uses an AMRAP set and the working set is increased based on how many additional reps you were able to do. The built-in version of GZCL uses a four week mesocycle.
